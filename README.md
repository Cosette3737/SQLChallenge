SQL Challenge

Analysis of employee databases that include breakdown of employee details including salary, title, and hire dates.  Each of 6 files are combined into one database in pgAdmin, and analyzed with the help of 8 queries that allow list creation of employee details.  Further analysis with Jupyter Lab allows the employee salary to be analyzed by title and overall average range.  IF we look at the average salary per title bar graph, we can see that the average salary for each title is between 47,000-58,000, even for Management, Senior staff, and engineers.  It appears most of hte staff in this dataset have very similar salaries and doesn't appear accurate.
